In this part of the training module, we were required to control the motor speed and direction of the rover. This was achieved using python and additional module/package managers were required such as socket and pynput. Two files, a client and server were created to interact with each other. We used local ip address to connect to the server which also received all the inputs sent by the client server. A while loop was created in server.py which correctly checks if the inputs received are valid or not. If an invalid input was received the program would terminate which was also true if the 'esc' key was pressed.


Errors:

I was unable to send the information of the buttons pressed in client to the server. No output was seen.
